To run the code, run the main function in the Main class.

After the program is run an output.txt file will be created in the Resources folder. This file will
contain information about the best and worst solutions at a given generation for each trial. It will
provide the objective fitness value of the best and worst solutions as well as the actual binary solutions.

IMPORTANT:
In order to use a specific problem instance, navigate to the FileScanner class. Here the FILENAME string needs
to be modified with a specific file name and path. The different problem instances can be found in the Resources folder.
The program will throw and print an exception in the console if the file is not found.
